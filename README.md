**Tow boats by mooring them to new towing cleats.**

Adds six towing cleats to each big boat.
Optionally adds two towing cleats to each small boat.

**Caveats**
- The boat doing the towing is not affected by the boat(s) being towed (yet).
- All boats upstream of (towing) the current boat will get full physics. Framerate beware.
- Boats downstream of the current boat will get full or limited physics depending on settings.

**Settings:**
- Performance mode: Set how many boats in the chain behind the current boat get full physics. (boat towed by boat towed by boat, etc.)
- Small boats can tow: Add towing cleats to small boats.

**Experimental settings:**
- Drag: Allow boats to pull on the boat towing them (buggy)

**Warnings:**
- Towing tends to mean having boats in close proximity, which often causes Sailwind physics to get weird.
- If you recover while towing a boat, only your current boat will be recovered. All others will be left behind.
